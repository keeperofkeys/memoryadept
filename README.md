Memory Adept - keep track of the whereabouts of your Magic cards

This project was inspired by a common problem I have: where are my copies of Path To Exile?

The premise is very simple: you register locations (could be decks, but that pile of cards beside your bed is equally valid) and tell memoryadept what's currently there. Then, a simple search will help you retrieve your Paths when they're needed.

I am using Django 1.6.2 for the backend, and jQuery 1.9.1 for all the ajax-y magic. 

My goal is to make the UI as slick and easy to use as possible, since I have a lot of decks and a lot of cards to register.
